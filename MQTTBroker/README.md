# MQTT Broker setup

Here will be explained how to set up the MQTT broker for various devices. The MQTT broker is the software that handles all the communication between devices. It enables the ability for devices to subscribe or publish to topics and have it all work together. This guide is based on the guides from http://www.steves-internet-guide.com.


## Install MQTT pi/Debian based linux

First, make sure the device has access to the internet. Having access to the internet is not the same as having a connection with the router. The router needs to be able to access the internet (like google.com). When you have access to the internet start with making sure the device is up to date. This can be done with the following two commands;
- ```sudo apt update```
- ```sudo apt upgrade```

When everything is up to date you have to install the mosquitto broker which can be done with the following command
- ```sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients```

Now to make sure mosquitto can be accessed by other devices, use the command '''sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf''' in the terminal. A command-line editor will open in this file add the following line:
- listener 1883 0.0.0.0
1883 is the network port where you can find the broker. You can change this if you want, but it is not necessary. The second part tells mosquitto to listen to devices with all sorts of IP addresses. Not only it's own.


To be able to connect devices to the broker, you have to know the IP address of the device the broker runs on. It can be found with the following command;
-```sudo ifconfig```
The IP is most likely something like 192.168.x.xxx. If you are using SSH to fill in commands you should most likely already know the IP of the device the broker runs on. Because otherwise, you would not be able to use SSH.

However, now everyone that has access to your private network has access to the data that is being sent. This is why the next step is to make it password protected. To have an easy overview of messages being sent to and from your broker you can use a tool like [MQTT explorer](http://mqtt-explorer.com/).

### Setup password MQTT pi/Debian

start with the command ```sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/credentials ItechLab``` where ItechLab is the username and credentials the name of the file where created users will be stored in. This can be whatever you want it to be, but when following the tutorials it is easier to use the same name
When this command has been entered you are being promted to enter a password twice. Make sure it is somewhat secure and that you remember it.

At the moment there still is no need to enter a username and password to connect to the broker. There is only a user that is created but the use of it is not yet enforced. This is why there are some changes needed in the MQTT config file. Start with ```sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf```. Nano is the editor that works in the command line, the part after that is the location of the file. Now that the file is open add the following two lines at the bottom;

- ```allow_anonymous false```
- ```password_file /etc/mosquitto/credentials```
If you choose a different name for the file passwords are stored in or location. The "```/etc/mosquitto/credentials```" will be something else.
 When the lines have been added close the editor with ```ctrl x``` and press ```y``` to confirm. 
 To enforce the new rules in the config  type ```sudo service mosquitto restart``` in the command prompt.
 
 ## Setup MQTT on Windows 10
 Start with downloading the MQTT.exe (install file) from [here](https://mosquitto.org/download/) and grab the mosquitto-x.x.x-install-windows-x64.exe file under Windows.
 When downloaded dubbel click the file to start installing it, and just go through the installer.
 
 When the installer has been completed open your command prompt as an administrator.
 - running programmes as an administrator can be done by searching for it in windows search and right-clicking it.

Now type in ``sc start mosquitto`` and it should start. It will start automatically when your computer turns on from now on.
Type in ``sc query mosquitto`` to check if it is running it should look something like this;

Now edit the config file of mosquitto to ensure it can be found by devices that are not the computer/laptop itself.
Start with opening notepad or another text editor as administrator the same way as done with the command prompt.
Go to **File->Openâ€¦** and locate the config file. It should be in ``C:\Program Files\mosquitto`` and the file is called mosquitto.conf. Make sure you select all files so notepad can not only see .txt files.
Now add at the top the following two lines;
- ``listener 1883 0.0.0.0``
- ``allow_anonymous true``
Now use ``ctrl s`` to save it.


The second line will be changed later to make it more secure.
Now put the following steps in the command prompt that should still be open as administrator.;
- ``sc stop mosquitto`` 
- ``cd C:\Program Files\mosquitto``  (This is if the default installation location has been used for mosquitto.)
- ``mosquitto -c mosquitto.conf``


A prompt should now pop-up asking for network permissions.

Click on allow access so devices can find the MQTT broker on your computer.
To have an easy overview of messages being sent from and to your broker, you can use a tool like [MQTT explorer](http://mqtt-explorer.com/).

### Setup password MQTT Windows 10 
Begin again with opening the command prompt again as administrator (not needed if still open) and use the following two commands.
Again go to the mosquitto folder with ``cd C:\Program Files\mosquitto`` and now type make a user and a credentials file, the file will be called **credentials** and the user **itechlab** ``mosquitto_passwd -c credentials itechlab``. You will be asked to type in a password twice, make sure you remember it since it will be needed to connect to the broker in the future. You can choose a different user name than itechlab.

 
 Now type in ``sc stop mosquitto`` to stop mosquitto so the config file can be edited. To do this open notepad as adminstrator and go to file->open... and go to ``c:\program files\mosquitto``. Make sure you have selected to see all files and open the mosquitto.conf file.
 In the file change the line **allow_anonymous true** to **allow_anonymous false**. Save with ``ctrl s``.
 Not type ``sc start mosquitto`` in the command prompt and it should work now.
