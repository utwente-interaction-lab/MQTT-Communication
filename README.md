# MQTT Communication
This tutorial is about setting up MQTT with an Espressif esp32. MQTT is a way for devices to send and receive messages to each other. The software that manages all this is called a broker. There will be an explanation and example code for all parts needed to setup up MQTT successfully. The parts needed and what will be explained are listed below in the order you need them;


- [Pi setup](https://github.com/utwente-interaction-lab/MQTT-Communication/tree/main/Pi%20Setup) (if you want to the MQTT broker on the pi)
	- Install operating system
		- Setup WiFi
		- Setup SSH

- [Router Setup](https://github.com/utwente-interaction-lab/MQTT-Communication/tree/main/Router%20Setup)
	- Static IP

- [MQTT broker setup](https://github.com/utwente-interaction-lab/MQTT-Communication/tree/main/MQTTBroker)
	- Windows
	- Raspberry pi /Debian based linux
 
 - [Code ESP32](https://github.com/utwente-interaction-lab/MQTT-Communication/tree/main/ESP32%20Code)
	 - Arduino

- [Code python](https://github.com/utwente-interaction-lab/MQTT-Communication/tree/main/Python%20Code)
